[Roland TR-8080 Sequencer](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808) is an iconic drum machine made in the 1980s, known for its distinctive sound and influence on electronic music.
This project is a modern web-based sequencer that emulates the TR-8080's functionality, allowing users to create and manipulate drum patterns in their browser.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies and run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

sound might not work in chromium based browsers, use Firefox.

## TODOS:

- [ ] Add breakbeats patterns
- [ ] Add Midi support ( to hook up with e.g: korg nanokontrol 2)
- [ ] Planning to use a circle of fifths random chord progression for the lead synth part to layer over the drum sequence.
- [ ] Record/Export wav.
- [ ] Prettier UI.
- [ ] Clean up code (page.tsx).
